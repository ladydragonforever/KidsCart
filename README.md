Interactive lunchbox planner app for busy working parents!

[Live Site](https://kidscart.herokuapp.com/)

## Background and Overview

KidsCart is made to tackle three main challenges faced by working parents by:

  * Making it easy and quick to find good/healthy lunbox receipes for kids
  * Making it easy to manually compile lunchbox receipes into shopping list and organise them for future reuse 
  * Allowing you to visualize how a normal receipe fits into lunchbox and edit it with an interactive interface

KidsCart has: 

  * an interactive interface for choosing lunchbox preferences; 
  * tailored receipes are automatically generated based on user's preferences; 
  * user can add, replace, edit, delete, and create their lunchbox with ease.
  
## Functionalities and Highlights 

### Features

Search
 * Our search function allows users to search for lunchbox receipes without being logged in, as well as search for meals to replace pre-generated ones.
 * The search function is case insensitive and users can search by category or key words. 
 
Food preference selection
 * Users can choose their favorite food category with specific ingredients through an interactive User Interface.
 * Users fill out information on each child and add food preference to those profiles
 
SelectedReceipes
 * Based on preference, lunchbox receipes will be automatically generated for each child.
 * Users can add new recipes from their search, and replace or delete pre-generated meals as desired. 

Profile and summary
 * Users can add more or delete child forms
 * Users can create their user profile
 * Users can see the summary of their selected meals, and can see the detail of each meal through links.
 
 ## Technologies used

The KidsCart app is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It features a back-end HTTP API used for retrieving user records in conjunction with client side rendering with React/Redux. Node.js and Express are used for backend routing. Considering the low-latency and scalability, we chose MongoDB as the database and Mongoose to manage schemas and queries.

- Backend
  * Express (the main framework)
  * Mongoose (to connect and interact with MongoDB)
  * Passport (for authentication)
  * Passport-jwt (for JSON web tokens)
  * JsonWebToken (to generate the tokens)
  * Body-parser (to parse data from requests)
  * Bcryptjs (for securing the password with hashing and salting)
  * Validator (for database validations)
  * Nodemon for watching the changes and updating instantly
  
- Frontend
  * React with Redux for state management
  * Axios for sending HTTP requests
  * Styling and animations done with CSS

### Bonus Features

- Edit and create a new lunch box receipe by the user
- Compiled shopping list
- Integration with Instacart

### Interactive interface for selecting meals
We made the food preference selection an interactive feature. In order to accomplish this, we used JavaScript to manipulate the HTML elements.

### Scalable and flexible database achitecture
We have four models where we store the date for meal receipes, user account, user's children, and selected meals. In the selected meals collection, we only store the mealID that points to the meal receipes collection instead of storing redundant meal receipe data. The structure is quite flexible and can face future scalability.
